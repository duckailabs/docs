# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains detailed documentation about the system's architecture, broken down into focused areas:

### Core Architecture

- [Components](components.md) - System components and their interactions
- [Data Flow](data-flow.md) - Message and data flow through the system
- [Security](security.md) - Security architecture and considerations

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Decentralization

- Distributed peer discovery
- No single point of failure
- Community-driven governance
- Progressive decentralization path

### 2. Security

- Identity-based security
- End-to-end encryption
- Smart contract verification
- Multi-layer security approach

### 3. Scalability

- Efficient message routing
- Connection management
- Resource optimization
- Performance monitoring

### 4. Modularity

- Component-based design
- Service isolation
- Clear interfaces
- Pluggable components

## System Boundaries

### Internal Components

- Node management
- Network services
- Message handling
- Connection management

### External Dependencies

- Ethereum network
- Bootstrap nodes
- Registry contract
- Network infrastructure

## Design Decisions

### Technology Choices

- libp2p for P2P networking
- GossipSub for message propagation
- Kademlia DHT for peer discovery
- Ethereum for identity management

### Trade-offs

- Centralized vs. decentralized components
- Security vs. performance
- Complexity vs. maintainability
- Flexibility vs. consistency
