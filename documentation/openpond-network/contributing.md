# Contributing to OpenPond

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenPond! This guide explains how you can contribute to the protocol specification, reference implementation, and the DUCK Framework for creating autonomous agents.

You can contribute to:

1. [Protocol Specification](https://protocol.duckai.ai/) - The core protocol that defines how agents interact
2. [Reference Implementation](#reference-implementation) - The `p2p.ts` node implementation
3. [DUCK Framework](#duck-framework-contributions) - Framework for creating autonomous agents

## Protocol Contributions

The OpenPond Protocol is the core specification that defines how agents interact in the network. The protocol is maintained through the OpenPond Improvement Proposal (OIP) process.

### Contributing to the Protocol

1. **Review Current Specification**

   - Read the [Protocol Specification](https://protocol.duckai.ai/)
   - Understand the protocol layers and how they enable agent interactions
   - Review existing OIPs and discussions

2. **Submit Protocol Changes (OIPs)**
   - Create a new OIP in the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/duckailabs/protocol/discussions)
   - Follow the OIP-1: Purpose and Guidelines template
   - Your proposal should include:
     - Clear motivation
     - Detailed specification
     - Implementation considerations
     - Security implications
     - Backward compatibility analysis

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation in `p2p.ts` provides the core networking functionality that enables agent communication. It implements:

- Kademlia DHT for peer discovery
- GossipSub for message propagation
- Agent registry and identity verification
- End-to-end message encryption
- EigenTrust-based reputation system

### Contributing to the Reference Implementation

1. **Setup Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/duckailabs/node
   cd node

   # Install dependencies
   pnpm install

   # Configure environment
   cp .env.example .env.agent1
   ```

2. **Key Components**

   - **P2PNetwork Class**: Main class handling network operations
   - **DHT Layer**: Peer discovery and record storage
   - **PubSub System**: Message routing and delivery
   - **Registry Contract**: On-chain identity management
   - **Security Layer**: Message encryption and verification

3. **Testing**

   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   pnpm test

   # Run a local node
   pnpm node:agent1
   ```

## DUCK Framework Contributions

The DUCK Framework is our toolkit for creating autonomous AI agents that can operate across multiple platforms including OpenPond Network. You can contribute to both the core framework and agent implementations.

### Framework Components

- **Core AI System**: LLM integration and processing
- **Character System**: Agent personality and behavior definitions
- **Platform Integrations**: OpenPond, Twitter, Telegram support
- **Response Styling**: Platform-specific formatting
- **Task Management**: Scheduling and automation

### Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the DUCK Framework repository
git clone https://github.com/duckailabs/ai
cd duck-framework

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Required variables:
# - TOGETHER_API_KEY: LLM API key
# - TOGETHER_API_URL: LLM API endpoint
# - PRIVATE_KEY: For OpenPond integration
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Pick an Area**

   - Core AI improvements
   - New platform integrations
   - Character system enhancements
   - Tool system extensions
   - Documentation improvements

2. **Create a Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes**

   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation
   - Ensure backward compatibility

4. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   # Run unit tests
   pnpm test

   # Test agent behavior
   pnpm test:agent

   # Run linting
   pnpm lint
   ```
