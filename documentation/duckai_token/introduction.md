# $DUCKAI Token

![Agent](/agent.png)

## Introduction

The $DUCKAI Token is a utility token that is used to help train DUCKAI AI agents on market sentiment analysis and web3 data aggregation. Right now, this data can be used for free on [Web3 Search](https://search.duckai.ai), in telegram via the [@duckunfiltered](https://t.me/duckunfiltered) agent, and on X via tagging the [@duckunfiltered](https://x.com/duckunfiltered) account. After [Season 1](#season-1) the agents should be sufficiently trained and ready to start token gating their insights and accepting $DUCKAI payments on the [OpenPond Network](https://openpond.network).
